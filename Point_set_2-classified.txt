The two dimensional point set is a class for geometric queries.
It supports circular, triangular and iso rectangular range searches and
nearest neighbor searches.
The point set is inherited from the \cgal Delaunay triangulation data type.
That means that it is a dynamic data structure supporting the insertion and
deletion of points.

This package also provides function template versions of the range search and nearest
neighbor query operations. They all have to be templated by the type of a \cgal Delaunay triangulation and provide functionality similar to the corresponding
member functions of the point set class.
