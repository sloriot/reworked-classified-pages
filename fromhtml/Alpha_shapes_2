<P>

This chapter presents a framework for alpha shapes. The description is based on
the articles [<A HREF="../biblio.html#Biblio_em-tdas-94">EM94</A>, <A HREF="../biblio.html#Biblio_e-was-92">Ede92</A>]. Alpha shapes are
the generalization of the convex hull of a point set. Let <span class="math">S</span> be a finite set of
points in <span class="math"><span class="sym">&#x211D;</span><SUP>d</SUP></span>, <span class="math">d = 2,3</span> and <span class="math">&alpha;</span> a parameter with <span class="math">0  <span class="sym">&le;</span> &alpha; <span class="sym">&le;</span> &infin;</span>. For <span class="math">&alpha;= &infin;</span>, the <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shape is the convex hull of <span class="math">S</span>. As 
<span class="math">&alpha;</span> decreases, the <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shape shrinks and develops cavities, as soon as 
a sphere of radius <span class="math">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline">&alpha;</span></span> can be put inside.
Finally, for <span class="math">&alpha;= 0</span>, the <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shape is the set <span class="math">S</span> itself.
<P>

We distinguish two versions of alpha shapes, one is based on the Delaunay
triangulation and the other on its generalization, the regular triangulation,
replacing the natural distance by the power to weighted points. The metric used
determines an underlying triangulation of the alpha shape and thus, the version
computed. 
The <I>basic alpha shape</I> (cf. <A HREF="../Alpha_shapes_2/Chapter_main.html#I1_SectClassicAS2D">42.4.1</A>) is associated with the Delaunay triangulation
(cf. <A HREF="../Triangulation_2/Chapter_main.html#Section_2D_Triangulations_Delaunay">37.5</A>). 
The <I>weighted alpha shape</I> (cf. <A HREF="../Alpha_shapes_2/Chapter_main.html#I1_SectWeightedAS2D">42.4.3</A>) is associated with the regular triangulation
(cf. <A HREF="../Triangulation_2/Chapter_main.html#Section_2D_Triangulations_Regular">37.6</A>).
<P>

There is a close connection between alpha shapes and the underlying
triangulations. More precisely, the <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-complex of <span class="math">S</span> is a
subcomplex of this triangulation of <span class="math">S</span>, containing the <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-exposed
<span class="math">k</span>-simplices, <span class="math">0  <span class="sym">&le;</span> k  <span class="sym">&le;</span> d</span>. A simplex is <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-exposed, if there is an
open disk (resp. ball) of radius <span class="math">&radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline">&alpha;</span></span> through the vertices of the
simplex that does not contain any other point of <span class="math">S</span>, for the metric used in
the computation of the underlying triangulation.  The corresponding
<span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shape is defined as the underlying interior space of the
<span class="math">&alpha;</span>-complex.
<P>

In general, an <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-complex is a non-connected and non-pure polytope, it
means, that one <span class="math">k</span>-simplex, <span class="math">0  <span class="sym">&le;</span> k  <span class="sym">&le;</span> d-1</span> is not necessary adjacent to
a <span class="math">(k+1)</span>-simplex.
<P>

The <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shapes of <span class="math">S</span> form a discrete family, even though they
are defined for all real numbers <span class="math">&alpha;</span> with <span class="math">0  <span class="sym">&le;</span> &alpha; <span class="sym">&le;</span> &infin;</span>. Thus, we can represent the entire family of <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shapes
of <span class="math">S</span> by the underlying triangulation of <span class="math">S</span>. In this representation
each <span class="math">k</span>-simplex of the underlying triangulation is associated with an
interval that specifies for which values of <span class="math">&alpha;</span> the <span class="math">k</span>-simplex
belongs to the <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shape. Relying on this result, the family of
<span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shapes can be computed efficiently and relatively
easily. Furthermore, we can select an appropriate <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shape from a
finite number of different <span class="math">&alpha;</span>-shapes and corresponding
<span class="math">&alpha;</span>-values.
