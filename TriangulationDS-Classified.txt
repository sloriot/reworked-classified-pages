triangulation of a topological sphere \f$ S^d\f$ of \f$ \R^{d+1}\f$, for 
\f$ d \in \{-1,0,1,2,3\}\f$. (See  \ref TDS3secintro.)

The vertex class of a 3D-triangulation data structure must define
a number of types and operations. 
The requirements that are of geometric nature are required only when
the triangulation data structure is used as a layer for the geometric
triangulation classes. (See Section  \ref TDS3secdesign.)

The cell class of a triangulation data structure stores
four handles to its four vertices and four handles to its four
neighbors. The vertices are indexed 0, 1, 2, and 3 in a consistent order.
The neighbor indexed \f$ i\f$ lies opposite to vertex `i`.

In degenerate dimensions, cells are used to store faces of maximal
dimension: in dimension 2, each cell represents only one
facet of index 3, and 3 edges \f$ (0,1)\f$, \f$ (1,2)\f$ and \f$ (2,0)\f$; in
dimension 1, each cell represents one edge \f$ (0,1)\f$. (See 
Section  \ref TDS3secintro.)

This class is a model for the concept of the 3D-triangulation data
structure `TriangulationDataStructure_3`.
It is templated by base classes for vertices and cells.

\cgal provides base vertex classes and base cell classes:

It defines operations on the indices of vertices and neighbors within
a cell of a triangulation.
