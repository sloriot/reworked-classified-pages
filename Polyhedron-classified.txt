Polyhedral surfaces in three dimensions are composed of vertices,
edges, facets and an incidence relationship on them. The organization
beneath is a halfedge data structure, which restricts the class of
representable surfaces to orientable 2-manifolds - with and without
boundary. If the surface is closed we call it a <I>polyhedron</I>.

The polyhedral surface is realized as a container class managing
vertices, halfedges, facets with their incidences, and maintaining the
combinatorial integrity of them. Its local types for the vertices,
halfedges and facets are documented separately.  A default traits
class, a default items class and an incremental builder conclude the
references. The polyhedral surface is based on the highly flexible
design of the halfedge data structure, see the reference for
`HalfedgeDS` in Chapter  \ref chapterHalfedgeDSRef
or \cite k-ugpdd-99, but the default instantiation of the polyhedral
surface can be used without knowing the halfedge data structure.
