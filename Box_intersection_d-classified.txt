We provide an efficient algorithm \cite cgal:ze-fsbi-02 for finding all
intersecting\footnote{Boxes represent volumes or point-sets. So, <I>intersection</I> means intersection of the point-set enclosed by the box and not only intersection of the boundary, of course.} pairs for large numbers of iso-oriented boxes, i.e.,
typically these will be bounding boxes of more complicated geometries.
For comparison and as a base case for other methods, we also offer the
simple all-pairs test as a generic function.
