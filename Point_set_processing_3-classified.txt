This \cgal component implements methods to analyze and process unorganized point sets. The input is an unorganized point set, possibly with attributes. This point set can be analyzed to measure average spacing, a global estimation of the point set density. Furthermore we can process it with functions devoted to simplification, outlier removal, smoothing, normal estimation and normal orientation.
