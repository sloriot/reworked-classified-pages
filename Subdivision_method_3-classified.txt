Subdivision methods recursively refine the control mesh
(i.e. the input mesh) and generate points approximating
the limit surface.
Designed to work on the class `Polyhedron_3`,
- `Subdivision_method_3` aims to be easy to use and to extend.
- `Subdivision_method_3` is not a class, but a namespace
which consists of four popular subdivision methods and their refinement
hosts. Supported subdivision methods include Catmull-Clark, Loop,
Doo-Sabin and \f$ \sqrt{3}\f$ subdivisions. Their respective refinement
hosts are PQQ, PTQ, DQQ and \f$ \sqrt{3}\f$ refinements.
Variations of those methods can be easily
extended by substituting the geometry computation of the refinement
host.
