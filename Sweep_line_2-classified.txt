This chapter describes three functions implemented using the
sweep-line algorithm: given a collection \f$ {\mathcal C}\f$ of 
planar curves, compute all intersection points among them,
obtain the set of maximal pairwise interior-disjoint subcurves
of the curves in \f$ {\mathcal C}\f$, or check whether there is at
least one pair of curves in \f$ {\mathcal C}\f$ that intersect in
their interior.

The first two operations are performed in an output-sensitive
manner.
